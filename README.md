# Home-Oh-No

Welcome to **Home-Oh-No**, the fun and easy way to track and share your home improvement adventures! Whether you're repainting the living room, landscaping the garden, or finally fixing that squeaky door, Home-Oh-No is your companion to stave off the option paralysis of having too many projects to work on in your soon-to-be dream home.

## Why I Needed It

Just two months after diving into my coding bootcamp, we took the exciting leap of buying a house. It's this charming place that, with just a touch of TLC, has the potential to truly sparkle. Managing my ADHD means I need a clear, at-a-glance view of all my ongoing projects. And, as it turns out, lots of my friends are also stepping into the world of homeownership. So, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to create something that not only helps me stay organized but also connects us as a community of budding homeowners

## Challenges Faced During Creation
As this was my first solo react project, I did hit a number of snags. Some notable ones included: 
<ul>
    <li>Dealing with a api fetch calls to get the tables needed</li>
    <li>Keeping elements positioned in my cards</li>
    <li>File structure conventions</li>
    <li>CSS naming to stop wonky inheritance</li>
    <li>And so many more, but I had a great time doing it!</li>
</ul>

## Installation

To get started with Home-Oh-No:

```bash
# Instructions on how to install your app

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
