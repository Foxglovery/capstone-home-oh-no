add check to delete job btn

~CSS~
make job cards smaller
make string number conditionaly render the word job as singular or plural
!!edit form
!!add job form
!!job details
On jobsbyhome, make home card appear in upper right corner, so can see job cards from the rip
stop user from being able to highlight with cursor
if user is on jobcards, edit button needs to be button 78



Done:
cut neg space off logo
shortened allhome --> jobsByHome by removing homeDetails bypass
